# pureharm-aws
Wrappers over the Java APIs for interacting with AWS. Depends on [pureharm](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm)

Currently the project is under heavy development, and is mostly driven by company needs until a stable version can be put out. At the end of the day this is a principled utility library that provides all glue to make web server development a breeze.
