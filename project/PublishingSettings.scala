/**
  * Publishing is done to bintray â€” to this org:
  * https://bintray.com/busymachines/maven-releases
  *
  * To set up bintray, just look at a combination of two docs:
  * https://github.com/sbt/sbt-bintray and a more user friendly:
  * http://queirozf.com/entries/publishing-an-sbt-project-onto-bintray-an-example
  *
  * TL;DR:
  * 1. create bintray account: https://bintray.com/
  * 2. request to be added as a member to busymachines organization : https://bintray.com/busymachines
  * 3. set your ~/.bintray/.credentials file to contain:
  * {{{
  * realm = Bintray API Realm
  * host = api.bintray.com
  * user = ${username that has publishing access to busymachines bintray org linked above}
  * password = ${get password by generating an API Key from the bintray UI}
  * }}}
  *
  * N.B. for historical purposes
  * For sync-ing to maven central you need to setup bintray to communicate via sonatype with
  * maven central. Quite complicated honestly. Should already be set-up at this point.
  * Anyway, the issue that gives you access to sonatype via which you can sync to maven central is here:
  * The username and password are the same as those to the Sonatype JIRA account.
  * https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-33718
